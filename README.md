# RoboGrip-Smart-Robotic-Arm-with-Wireless-Gesture-Control

The development of a robotic arm controlled by wireless hand gestures using Arduino and flex sensors combines various technological elements. The robotic arm itself is a mechanical structure designed to replicate human arm movements and is commonly used in applications like manufacturing and assembly. Arduino, an open-source electronics platform, serves as the central control unit, offering a user-friendly interface for programming and integrating components. Wireless communication, often facilitated by modules like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, enables remote control. Flex sensors, capable of detecting hand gestures through changes in resistance when bent, are strategically placed on a glove or fingers to capture gestures accurately. The Arduino board processes signals from the flex sensors, translating them into commands for the robotic arm's motors. 
The usage of robots in situations where conditions are uncertain, such as rescue missions, robots can be programmed to follow the orders of a human operator and complete the task as instructed. Gestures are very significant in people's daily lives. The gestures control device is only confined to space- electronics and partially in from any physical movements such as the face, hands, and so on. By making it easier to communicate with computers, The Human Machine Interface is improved via gesture recognition. Weâ€™ve used gesture controls in prostheses and power plant operations. This study describes how gestures may be used to operate a robotic arm wirelessly. HMI stands for human-machine interface.
